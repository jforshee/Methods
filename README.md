A collection of computer programming solutions to numerical methods problems for CS 321.

Files:

* cs321hw2: Compute the root of a non-linear equation and the error in your solution.
* cs321hw4: Perform integration with trapezoid and Simpson rules at 100, 500, 1000, 5000, 10000 points over some interval [a,b] and compute the error in your solutions.
* cs321hw5: Perform trapezoid integration on f(x) = x^{1/3} at 10, 100, 1000 points over an interval [a,b] and compute the error in your solutions. Also, perform the same integration using a change of variables x = t^3, avoiding the singularity at x = 0.
